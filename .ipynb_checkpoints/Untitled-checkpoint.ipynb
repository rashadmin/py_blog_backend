    "blog = '''So I just finished this book : newwhitepaper prompt engineering Author: Lee Boonstra since last month, actually not that I was reading it consistently because I was kinda busy with my project and academics stuff and pheeeew... It was worthwhile.\n",
    "I had undergone the deep learning ai Andrew Ng prompt engineering course but it was not as detailed as this. Probably because theirs was at the genesis of when it started and also became it was openAI, but this is Gemini based.\n",
    "Learnt chain of thought,tree of thought, self consistency, best practices and I learnt something... Instructions over constraints, well you are better off giving the prompt of what you want it to do than telling it what not to do cause telling it what not to do brings doubt as to whether what to do will also be wrong and stuff. It's fun , inspirational, educational and beautiful... Now I can wait to go back to my joyðŸ˜Œ... Coding the project using the prompt engineering ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚.The insightful part of the book were ,the best practices as to writing prompting, the instructions over constraint section e.t.c . it differ from andrew ng's course in ways like andrew talked about best practices but didn''t focus on the type of prompting, probably hearing the word chain of though and self consitency by the model for the first time. I missed that stuff just this last 5-7 days I guess, I'm still maintaining my commit streak on GitHub, just that I'm ensuring that I just change something, nothing serious'''"
